##  Analyst \| Researcher \| Data Specialist

My journey began in a wet lab, studying epigenetics in *C. elegans*. This foundation ignited a passion for hypothesis-driven research. As I delved deeper into data analysis using R, a new world of possibilities opened up.

Driven by curiosity, I immersed myself in the art and science of data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. Through hands-on projects, I solidify my understanding and share my learnings with the world.

This website is a testament to my data exploration. Here, I document my projects, providing detailed methodologies alongside results.
